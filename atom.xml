These data processing pipelines, which are currently executed on the CPU, have become a bottleneck, limiting overall throughput.</p>
<p>DALI is a high performance alternative to built-in data loaders and data iterators. Developers can now run their data processing pipelines on the GPU, reducing the total time it takes to train a neural network. Data processing pipelines implemented using DALI are portable because they can easily be retargeted to TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我自认为还是一个喜欢写东西，喜欢分享的一个人，所以我一直希望能持续的写点东西记录日常的生活和工作。<br>
可是一直却没有坚持下去。</p>
<ul>
<li>用人人网记录过生活日志</li>
<li>用百度空间记录过学习笔记</li>
<li>尝试过CSDN</li>
<li>尝试过新浪博客</li>
<li>尝试过微信公众号</li>
<li>尝试过搭建wordpress的网站</li>
<li>尝试过github pages</li>
</ul>
<p>最终都无疾而终。<br>
结束的原因有很多，首先一个是平台本身不存在了，另外一个是交互很差。</p>
<p>作为一名程序员，我其实<strong>特别羡慕</strong>其他程序员那样搞一个自己的个人网站，或者搞个静态网站托管在github pages上。</p>
<p>其实使用github pages我尝试过很多次，用hexo或者其他什么工具，来来回回搞过很多次了。<br>
github page还是很不错的，结束的原因是我不懂这些配置。从网上东拼西凑，首先是很乱，另外是没有满意的效果，心累。<br>
github page的缺点，正如很多网上说的那样，搞了半天的静态网站，搞完后不想写了。</p>
<p>可是我一直希望能有个地方，可以记录自己的一些想法。</p>
<ul>
<li>工作日志，可以用来分享工作经验，与同行交流</li>
<li>生活日志，可以记录生活，等待若干年后，我们的后代，可以从互联网上，了解我们年轻时的想法</li>
<li>这个地方，需要稳定，可维护，文档可以迁移，可以评论，交互</li>
</ul>
<p>我暂时使用的是为知笔记+会员。为知笔记作为笔记本，还是很不错的，但是缺少了分享功能，于是我购买了VIP，当写一些文章的时候，就创建外链，分享到微信朋友圈。<br>
可是这样局限还是很大。</p>
<p>我其实挺希望自己能在github pages上有一个简单易用的书写文章的方式。在一次偶然中，让我发现了这个软件，<strong>Gridea</strong>，这个软件可以让用户专注在写作上，不需要考虑乱七八糟的静态网站维护的工作，甚至主题也可以更换，如果不满意，还可以购买别人制作的主题。</p>
<p>虽然评论系统我还没搞上，但是Gridea本身支持评论系统，等我有精力的时候，我可以尝试下。</p>
<p>因此使用Gridea写下第一篇日志，念念不忘必有回响。<br>
希望自己能在Gridea的帮助下，扎根Github pages, 持续输出，分享生活与工作中的点滴。</p>
