<h2 id="dali">DALI</h2>
<p>The NVIDIA Data Loading Library (DALI) is a portable, open source library for decoding and augmenting images,videos and speech to accelerate deep learning applications. DALI reduces latency and training time, mitigating bottlenecks, by overlapping training and pre-processing. It provides a drop-in replacement for built in data loaders and data iterators in popular deep learning frameworks for easy integration or retargeting to different frameworks.</p>
<p>Training neural networks with images requires developers to first normalize those images. Moreover images are often compressed to save on storage. Developers have therefore built multi-stage data processing pipelines that include loading, decoding, cropping, resizing, and many other augmentation operators. These data processing pipelines, which are currently executed on the CPU, have become a bottleneck, limiting overall throughput.</p>
<p>DALI is a high performance alternative to built-in data loaders and data iterators. Developers can now run their data processing pipelines on the GPU, reducing the total time it takes to train a neural network. Data processing pipelines implemented using DALI are portable because they can easily be retargeted to TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet.</p>

The NVIDIA Transfer Learning Toolkit (TLT) is the AI toolkit that abstracts away the AI/DL framework complexity and leverages high quality pre-trained models to enable you to build production quality models faster with only a fraction of data required.</p>
<p>A toolkit for anyone building AI apps and services, TLT helps reduce costs associated with large scale data collection, labeling, and eliminates the burden of training AI/ML models from scratch.</p>
<p>With TLT, you can use NVIDIA’s <strong>production quality pre-trained models</strong> and deploy as is or apply minimal fine-tuning for various computer vision and conversational AI use-cases. TLT is a core component of NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/TAO">Train, Adapt and Optimize (TAO) platform</a>, a UI-based, guided workflow for creating AI</p>
